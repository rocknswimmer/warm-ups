// I feel an hour long coding challenge taken for a job or in interview should count in git hub tracking so heres the log

//1-3 before I started this log
//2/1/23 vanguard basic test
//2/8/23 confident test simple algorithms, then abused with route learning ?'s about html and css
//3/4 moody though coding 2 bitwise overcomplication of hard-med problems and a sql with a fun group by with average
// 3/5 cisco had to take in python and the accidentally submitted test after only answering the last ?
// 3/16 koddi another python test, this time I did not early submit and managed to answer both despite a tab + space default spacing that threw errors on the first questions complicating my learning durring the challenge
//3/22/23 smoothstack, pretty challengeing ? if I read it right, requireing the inputs to the function to be checked as meeting constraints, adding to the challenge over a leetcode version of the problem got an 86% even without a solution to the question that wanted a function written in bash
// 4/6 woven, another python challenge final solution recieving an error from lack of knowledge of how to call the first function I was tasked with building in the second and ran out of time to debug due to all the other translating to python debugging I had to do like accessing an objects id using bracket notation instead of dot notation
//4/9 citadel first problem was pretty good, second problem was all about triangles, and did not provide enough information to not have to google to find the formulas necessary to solve the problem.
//5/4 r&r solved logic questions in a time limit around a rate of 3 per minute then over 200 questions to create a psych profile
//5/19 betterhelps challenge at http://54.69.17.62/challenge/ from the application - sql saved for learning, browser fix needs more experiementation
//6/8 practice for Hackathon challenge in two days got 100% on first question once I realized x did not have to be in array of numbers, so just needed to log average + 1, second I got to 96% after reducing time by only going to the square root when finding factors for numbers and updating common in the second factors loop
//6/10 -still unsure if will start at midnight or 4 am since I have seen both times with the confirmation email not matching the time listed on the site, and the google calendar failing to save because the listed times are noon and 1:30am same day.
//6/16 start of hacker earth june circuits, gonna take some major refactoring. First solution 60% accepted 40% timed out after refactoring, but it jumps around with which 40% are timming out, have only 20% I have not passed
//6/18 re - 3 js questions 2/3 done, with the third being choice tree, and not quite clear enough instructions for me to code a full function, still got 4/15 tests for that one
//6/19 took a look at second wave of problems, had to adjust input since format in submission does not match the one in testing ground
//6/20 passed first two cases then timed out on rest
//6/22 shocking research results
//7/1 july starter ?'s from hacker Earth -
// 7/11 jp passed 9/10 on first problem due to using recusion and not knowing a fancy algorithm to speed things up. second question ran into too many translation issues
// 7/23 docusigns hacker earth back end 5 years xp challenge to see how I could do. The coding was easier than some entry level questions other than the language being a more gating c#. Multiple choice questions where a bit above me, but understoode what was being asked

//logic or psych assessments
//5/18 answered 38/40 ?s in 20 mnutes
//5/20 getting more and more kinda similar logic ones got like 40/50 in  15 but two were speed guess/skips
//6/23 int commute
//6/26 aptitude training
//6/27 warm-up before assagnment, read instructions more carefully and solidify reasoning with double check if enough time. 70/90 questions between a 15 for 50 and a 20 for 40
//6/28 random psych ?
//7/18 customer supporst situations: profficient

//learning xp
// GitLabs DevSecOps 6/15
// t1 industry practices 7/12
// researching new technology for project
