// I feel an hour long coding challenge taken for a job or in interview should count in git hub tracking so heres the log

//1-3 before I started this log
//2/1/23 vanguard basic test
//2/8/23 confident test simple algorithms, then abused with route learning ?'s about html and css
//3/4 moody though coding 2 bitwise overcomplication of hard-med problems and a sql with a fun group by with average
// 3/5 cisco had to take in python and the accidentally submitted test after only answering the last ?
// 3/16 koddi another python test, this time I did not early submit and managed to answer both despite a tab + space default spacing that threw errors on the first questions complicating my learning durring the challenge
//3/22/23 smoothstack, pretty challengeing ? if I read it right, requireing the inputs to the function to be checked as meeting constraints, adding to the challenge over a leetcode version of the problem got an 86% even without a solution to the question that wanted a function written in bash
